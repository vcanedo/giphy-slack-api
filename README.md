# giphy-slack-api

Just a stupid ass API implementation with GIPHY and SLACK's API to send random GIFS to my coworker's slack channels.

## To run
Create .env file with your GIPHY_API_KEY and SLACK_BOT_TOKEN variables by following Giphy's API and Slack's Bot creation doc

Simple python3 file just run 'python3 filename' to execute it. Created JS file to execute the same command, but haven't tested it
